# Snake-Game

# Description
This is a simple Snake Game made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and HTML Canvas.
The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eats apples, grow longer
and earn points. The goal is to score as much points as possible without crashing
into the wall's or the snake's own body.

# Features
- Snake movement using arrow keys
- Score tracker that increases with each apple eaten
- Snake grows longer
- Game Over screen
- Eating sound effect

# Motivation
I created this project to learn something new (HTML canvas) and improve my other programming skills.

# Challenges/Learning
One challenge I faced was making the snake not move pasted the wall.
I learned canvas functions and game loops.
